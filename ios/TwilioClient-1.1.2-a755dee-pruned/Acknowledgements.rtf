\b\fs30 CRC32 algorithm\

\b0\fs26 This is an implementation of CRC32. See ISO 3309 and ITU-T V.42 for a formal specification\
\
This file is partly taken from Crypto++ library (http://www.cryptopp.com) and http://www.di-mgt.com.au/crypto.html#CRC.\
\
Since the original version of the code is put in public domain, this file is put on public domain as well.\
\
\

\b\fs30 MD5 hashing implementation\

\b0\fs26 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm. The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed. This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.\
\
Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc. This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent, except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese with every copy.\
\
To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.\
